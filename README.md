# 2017-DSGRN-GeneNetworksToDynamicPhenotypes

## Overview 

This code repository is supplemental to the paper "From gene networks to their dynamic phenotypes" by Bree Cummins, Tomas Gedeon, Shaun Harker, and Konstantin Mischaikow. It provides instructions for reproducing the computational results presented therein.

## Installation


## Instructions


### Figure 4

```bash
cd Figure4
./Compute.sh
# Wait until jobs are finished.
./Postprocess.sh
```

### Figure 5

```bash
cd Figure4
./Compute.sh
# Wait until jobs are finished.
./Postprocess.sh
```


### Figure 6

```bash
cd Figure6
./Compute.sh
# Wait until jobs are finished.
./Postprocess.sh
```

## Notes

The computations are quite lengthly and with hardware available in 2017 require approximately 4 months to complete on a single CPU. On the other hand they can be done in parallel on a cluster (which is the setting in which the results were computed)
